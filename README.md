This repo is for the part b of Assignment 2. You are asked to produce a beautiful work of art using Fractals on the Complex plane (see slides for week 4 for more info).

Write a report in Rmarkdown including your R code (for this assignment, it is ok just to run the code I provided to you), and describing the functions you tried, but also including some pretty pictures for display at the start of class when the assignment is due.  Using Râ€™s color palette options, and/or the gg-plot package, is your friend here when it comes to making pretty pictures.

You need to upload both your Rmarkdown file and the picture you produced (as a separate image file). Please put those in your copy of this repo and then pust it back to github so that I can see it. 

Please try to make your picture look nice (i.e. no axis lines, preferaqbly in a nice frame) and please do give it a title that is as artily pretentious as you can manage.

Note that the deadline for this assignbment is midnight on Wednesday Feb 23rd (to give me time to put the pictures into a slide show for class).
